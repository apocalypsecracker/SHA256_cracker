# SHA256_cracker
This is a CLI tool build to crack hashes at lighting speed with minimal effort.

From the version 2.2.1 and above, Modes option are introduced for more versatility. This gave access to Normal(-n) and Verbose(-v) modes, Eventually modes are improved to be more versatile from version 3.3.3 where Normal mode completely replaced with Multifast(-m) which gave it ability to read hashes from a text file and crack those automatically one by one using specified wordlist. If you are using a older version please be wary.

## Modes
- `-v`, `--verbose`
- `-m`, `--multifast`

### Example Usage for Multi Fast Mode:
1. `./sha256_cracker e2c587ac5155e215da971f07fb1aba71788ef2fa423a7efb251267419e146521 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -m`
2. `./sha256_cracker ebf13de02b7406fd14c97ec3d136e6b36a27b53dd327602e7ace6912ccbccfa9 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --multifast`
3. `./sha256_cracker path/to/the/hashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -m`
4. `./sha256_cracker path/to/the/hashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`

### Example Usage for Verbose Mode:
1. `./sha256_cracker e2c587ac5155e215da971f07fb1aba71788ef2fa423a7efb251267419e146521 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -v`
2. `./sha256_cracker ebf13de02b7406fd14c97ec3d136e6b36a27b53dd327602e7ace6912ccbccfa9 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --verbose`
3. `./sha256_cracker path/to/the/hashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -v`

**Note:** Multi Fast mode is significantly faster than Verbose mode. Thus, choosing Multi Fast mode is recommended. If no modes are specified, Multi Fast mode will be selected automatically.

### Usage for Linux Binary
- Download the latest version of Linux Executable Binary from here:- https://github.com/apocalypsecracker/SHA256_cracker/releases/latest
- Give executable permissions to the binary:
```
chmod +x sha256_cracker
```
- then, run :- `./sha256_cracker <hash> <Path_To_The_wordlist> <Mode>`

---
- **Placing into the executable path(Optional)**

* I know always changing into the directory where sha256_cracker lives and executing it, is a pain in the ass. Don't worry I have a solution for you, Do the following steps carefully:
- 'cd' into the directory where sha256_cracker is stored generally in Downloads.
- Now type this in the terminal: 
```
sudo mv sha256_cracker /usr/local/bin

```
* That's all you've made it, Now you can execute sha256_cracker anywhere from the Terminal Emulator like this:
```
sha256_cracker
```

### Usage for Windows executable
- Download the latest version of Windows-x86 executable from here:- https://github.com/apocalypsecracker/SHA256_cracker/releases/latest
- Open Command Prompt or Powershell:
- Now go to the path where sha256_cracker.exe located at or Open cmd from the path
- then, run :- `./sha256_cracker.exe <hash> <Path_To_The_wordlist> <Mode>` or simply `sha256_cracker.exe <hash> <Path_To_The_wordlist> <Mode>`

### Usage for Source
- Get into the directory of the project(eg: `cd sha256_cracker`)
**Note: This require cargo to be installed on the system as a prerequesite. For cargo installation refer here:** https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html
- Then run below command with correct options.
**`cargo run <sha256_hash> <Path_to_password_dictionary> <Mode>`**(eg: cargo run 79bb8d29bad9c9534b5b0d154febf0cec5efbdb9d15821bb6675af2636a061d2 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -n)
- Successful output might look likes this

### Creator Answered Questions
**Which should I choose, Binary or Source?**
- In my opinion Choosing binary would be better because it is much easier to use and less likely to get in to issue. **Binaries are much more faster.** Building from source is different and much more complicated, There are also prerequesite for building from source like cargo need to be installed. However if you can manage technical things in building and your confident that you can troubleshoot any issues and also if you want new updated version with new features and fixes (Note:might also have bugs too) then this should be your choice  

**What are ignored words?**
- While reading a wordlist and it's contents some words may contain unknown or complicated structure of words and symbols in a way where it cannot be converted to sha256 hash. Those words will be ignored and moved to next. 

**What are the versions of executable binaries, which are tagged as Pre-release?**
- Pre-release versions are generally not optimized binaries which can work fine but are slow and takes more disk space than Optimized binaries.
